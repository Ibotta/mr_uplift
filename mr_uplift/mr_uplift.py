        Idea is to calculate full range of objective functions. Here each observation
        is assigned a random objective function and the ERUPT is calculated on this.

        Args:
          x (np.array): new data to predict. Will use test data if not given
          y (np.array): responses
          t (np.array): treatments

          if none is assigned it randomly create weights
          treatments (np.array): treatments to use in erupt calculations
          calibrator (boolean): If true will use the trained calibrator to transform
            responses. Otherwise will use the response inverse transformer
          random_seed (int): seed for random weights matrix if none are assigned
          response_transformer (boolean): If true will use the trained scaler to transform
            responses. I've noticed that using this in production degrades performance
            becuase model optimizes scaled data.
