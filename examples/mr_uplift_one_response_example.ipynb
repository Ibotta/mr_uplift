    "### Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we are data scientists working for a startup that would like to be more profitibile. As a tactic to increase user activity the company gives all users an expensive bonus (referred to as the treatment). In order to reduce costs we were assigned the task of using data to find a subset of users that should continue receiving the costly treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are given explanatory variables for users $X$, a random treatment of whether a users recieved the treatment or not $T$, and response variable of profitibility $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use uplift models and the IbottaUplift package specifically to find users\n",
    "who should receive the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uplift Problem Setup\n",
    "The general setup for a lift model is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$y$: Response variable of interest you‚Äôd like to maximize. Here it is profitibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "$X$: User level covariates. Includes things like previous activity per user.\n",
    "\n",
    "$T$: The randomly assigned treatment. In this case it is whether or not to give a bonus to a particular user and is binary. Assume that the distribution and assignment of a treatment is uniform and random.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the data $(y, X, T)$ the goal is to build a treatment assignment policy ùúã(x) that will use $X$ to assign $T$ that maximizes the value of $y$. Or in this case we want to use user history to assign whether to give a bonus to a user in order to maximize profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A frequent practice is to model the expected outcome $y_i$ under different treatments and choose the treatment $T$ that maximizes $y_i$ for each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " \\pi(x_i) =argmax \\:_{t \\in T} E[y_i | X=x_i, T=t]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to do this and can be done with a run of the mill ML algorithm that incorporates interactions. IbottaUplift uses a neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get the counterfactual for each treatment one needs to predict with different values of $t$. This calculation is closely related to to creating an [ICE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.6392.pdf) plot with the treatment variable.\n",

    "After gridsearching we want to know how much better the model is than the current state. Evaluating the out-of-sample importance is key to ensure the model will perform as intended in production. While there are other metrics such as the Qini metric they are usually limited to single treatment case. ERUPT is the only metric I'm aware of that can be applied to multiple treatments and provides an unbiased estimate what would happen if the model were applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ERUPT\n",
    "Suppose you have an observation where ùúã(x) proposes a treatment of not giving bonus and the randomly assigned treatment was given a bonus. Since these do not align it‚Äôs not clear we can say anything about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the optimal treatment for a model is equal to the assigned treatment we can include that observation in our proposed treatment examples. We go through this exercise for all observations and calculate the response mean for only those where the ùúã(x) = assigned treatment. This is our estimated value of y under the model! Mathematically it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\sum_i y_i I(\\pi(x_i) = t_i)} {\\sum_i I(\\pi(x_i)=t_i)}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It outputs two dataframes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The first dataframe shows the ERUPT metric and standard deviation for the model assignment. In this example it tells us the expected profit if we were to use this model. In addition we can also see a 'random' row under the assignment column. This uses the same distribution as $\\pi(x)$ but shuffles the treatments so as to make it a random assignment. Looking at the difference between the Model and Random assignments should tell us if the model is learning the individual treatment effects well. \n",
