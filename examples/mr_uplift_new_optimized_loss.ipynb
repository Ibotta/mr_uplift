    "### New Loss Function  \n",
    "\n",
    "Readers are encouraged to read the [example on single responses](https://github.com/Ibotta/ibotta_uplift/blob/master/examples/mr_uplift_one_response_example.ipynb) for a more thorough background on uplift models and the ERUPT metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "To recap we start with the decision function defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " \\pi(x_i) =argmax \\:_{t \\in T} E[y_i | X=x_i, T=t]\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the function that determines whether to assign a user a particular treatment for a single response we wish to maximize. It just says that we apply the treatment with the highest expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To exaluate the decision function the ERUPT metric is used. It estimates the expected value of the decision function on an out-of-sample dataset. Assuming that the treatments are uniformly (all treatments have same number of observations) and randomly assigned the ERUPT metric is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ERUPT(pi(x),y,t) \\propto \\sum_{i}^N y_i I(\\pi(x_i) = t_i) \\tag{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The original loss functions used in mr_uplift have used a mean squared error (MSE) function $f(x,t)$ to estimate $E[y_i | X=x_i, T=t]$ :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " MSE(y,f(x,t)) = 1/N \\sum_{i}^N (y_i-f(X=x_i, T=t_i))^2\n",
    "\\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory this should produce an estimator that approximates the interaction between $x$ and $t$ neccesary to build a good decision function $\\pi(x_i)$. However, in practice thie interaction effect is tricky to estimate because the it is generally small relative to main effects and noise in the response. Several researchers have developed in techniques order to estimate this (see [Zhao, Fang, Simchi-Levi](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08492.pdf?source=post_page---------------------------), [Athey, Tibshirani, Wager](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.01271.pdf), [Hitsch, Misra](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3111957) to name a few).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach taken here follows an approach developed by [Weiss](https://medium.com/building-ibotta/maximizing-the-erupt-metric-for-uplift-models-f8d7e57bfdf2) and [Fernandez-Loria, et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11532.pdf) in which it attempts to optimize the ERUPT function in $2$ directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to approximate that function we assign a 'probability' score to each treatment: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " optimizedloss(y,t,f(t,x)) =  \\sum_{i}^N \\sum_{t \\in T}^T y_{i,t}*p(t|x_i)  =  \\sum_{i}^N \\sum_{t \\in T}^T y_{i,t}*\\frac{e^{f(X=x_i, T=t)}}{\\sum_{t \\in T}e^{f(X=x_i, T=t)}}\n",
    "\\tag{4}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $y_{i_t}$ is equal to $y_{i}$ if user $i$ recieved treatment $t$, else zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "One major difference here compared with [Weiss](https://medium.com/building-ibotta/maximizing-the-erupt-metric-for-uplift-models-f8d7e57bfdf2) is that it explitly incorporates the treatments in the function $f()$ to be estimated. This should help regularize the estimation if the treatments have similar meta-data information. For instance; if the treatments are ordered then this model can take that information into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, MSE is also included in the loss function to create a weighted loss between the two. Including MSE should help when the estimated optimal treatment does not equal the treatment assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\alpha*optimizedloss(y,t,f(t,x)) + (1-\\alpha)*MSE(y,f(x,t))\n",
    "\\tag{5}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
